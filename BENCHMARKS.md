# Laya benchmarks

Every checkpoint answered **byte-identical questions** in each run (fixed seed). Jev figures are **third-party published, never measured here** — no TypeSafe API access — so sample sizes and prompts differ; treat them as indicative.

## Languages

### All 51 MASSIVE languages — intent, 20 options (random = 0.050)

About 100 cases per language, so a single-language accuracy carries roughly ±0.09 (95%); treat
small per-language gaps as noise. `bench_local.py` now reports `accuracy_ci95` per language and an
exact McNemar test for the paired english-vs-multilingual comparison.

### English vs the rest

| task | | laya | laya-multilingual |
|---|---|---|---|
| MASSIVE intent — English | **0.783** | 0.657 |
| MASSIVE intent — other languages | 0.306 | **0.451** |
| MASSIVE scenario — English | **0.603** | 0.560 |
| MASSIVE scenario — other languages | 0.281 | **0.439** |
| XNLI — English | **0.860** | 0.843 |
| XNLI — other languages | 0.521 | **0.731** |

The English checkpoint does not degrade gracefully outside English — it collapses, and stays confident doing so. Khmer: **0.000 accuracy at 0.952 confidence**. Its mean confidence never drops below 0.885 at any accuracy level, so confidence gating cannot catch it — which is why routing happens *before* the forward pass.

## Themes — the application workflows

Each is real labelled data, 400 cases, all three checkpoints. *held out* means the source was **not** in Laya's training mix.

| theme | laya | laya-multilingual | laya-typed-decisions | data |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Email spam | **0.993** | 0.993 | 0.958 | in training |
| Phishing | 0.980 | **0.993** | 0.940 | in training |
| LLM guardrails (jailbreak) | 0.708 | 0.755 | **0.762** | **held out** |
| Moderation (toxicity) | **0.530** | 0.525 | 0.530 | **held out** |
| RAG passage relevance | 0.625 | **0.657** | 0.625 | in training |
| Support triage (10-way queue) | 0.502 | **0.522** | 0.505 | in training |
| Model routing (domain) | 0.639 | 0.123 | **0.659** | held out |

**Where it is strong:** email spam 0.993 and phishing 0.993, both with ECE around 0.01 — production-grade, though both were in the training mix.

**Where it is weak:** moderation on held-out toxic-chat is 0.530 with macro-F1 0.400 — barely above chance on a balanced split. The demo Space has a Moderation tab; hand-picked examples work, real traffic does not. Guardrails at 0.708–0.762 is the honest jailbreak-detection number, consistent across two unrelated datasets (deepset prompt-injections measured 0.698 separately).

### On the public datasets where Jev numbers exist

| dataset | laya | laya-multilingual | laya-typed-decisions | Jev (published) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AG News (4 labels) | 0.950 | 0.930 | **0.953** | 0.910 |
| DAIR Emotion (6 labels) | 0.595 | 0.530 | **0.600** | 0.480 |
| banking77 (77 labels) | 0.425 | 0.425 | **0.492** | 0.870 |

> **Sampling caveat.** The numbers in this section were produced with `rows[:N]` sampling. The
> banking77 test split is sorted by label (40 rows per label), so the 400 banking77 cases covered
> only ~10 of the 77 intents, and support triage and phishing were scored on rows of their *train*
> split. The harnesses now sample stratified by label and tag train-split suites with
> `eval_split="train"`; these rows will be refreshed on the next run. Jev figures are third-party
> published (different n, label count and prompts) and are context, not a controlled comparison.

banking77 is the one clear loss, and it is architectural: a choice question's options share a fixed `head_max_len` budget, so 77 labels get roughly 4 tokens each and stop being distinguishable. Both checkpoints score **exactly 0.425**, which is what you would expect from a budget ceiling rather than a capability gap. Keep choice questions under ~20 options.

## typed-decisions — 400 cases, 2,000 decisions

| model | accuracy | soft acc | Brier | ECE | score MAE |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `laya-typed-decisions` | **0.766** | 0.471 | 0.061 | 0.213 | 0.242 |
| `laya` | 0.361 | 0.332 | 0.316 | 0.175 | 0.694 |
| `laya-multilingual` | 0.342 | 0.326 | 0.439 | 0.285 | 0.687 |
| *Jev 1.13.0 (published)* | *0.727* | *0.580* | *0.148* | *0.144* | *0.391* |
| *teacher ceiling* | *0.735* | *—* | *—* | *—* | *—* |
| *majority class* | *0.461* | *—* | *—* | *—* | *—* |
| *random guess* | *0.318* | *—* | *—* | *—* | *—* |

| workflow | laya-typed-decisions |
|---|---|
| agent trace observability | 0.730 |
| customer service | 0.764 |
| invoice processing | 0.804 |
| security incidents | 0.766 |

**The base checkpoints sit below the majority-class baseline** (0.362 and 0.342 against 0.461). All of the capability on this benchmark comes from fine-tuning.

## Speed (Tesla T4)

| questions per call | laya | laya-multilingual |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 39.5 ms | **32.8 ms** |
| 5 | 84.5 ms | **40.1 ms** |
| 10 | 158.6 ms | **72.3 ms** |
| 50 | 771.3 ms | **337.4 ms** |

103–332 questions/sec batched. Jev independently measured at 236-276 ms p50, so Laya answers one question roughly **6–7× faster**.

### Calibration

| | as shipped | temperature refit | 
|---|---|---|
| `laya` | 0.466 | **0.081** |
| `laya-multilingual` | 0.314 | **0.106** |

Both ship over-confident; `laya-multilingual` ships with no fitted temperatures at all. Refitting one temperature per (question type, option count) on held-out data is the single highest-value fix available, and takes ECE below Jev's measured 0.246.

The refit column fits and evaluates on two halves of the *same* suite, so it is an in-distribution
upper bound. The notebook now also reports `ece_loso` (temperatures fitted on every other suite)
and a single pooled `global_temperatures` set, which is what a new task would actually see.

### Option-order robustness

How often the answer changes when the options are permuted. Jev measured at 0.13.

| suite | laya | laya-multilingual |
|---|---|---|
| massive_intent.en | 0.150 | 0.230 |
| en.emotion | 0.040 | 0.090 |
| xnli.en | 0.000 | 0.015 |

At 20 options both are less order-stable than Jev — worth fixing with more aggressive option-order shuffling during training.

---

## Limits, stated plainly

- **Near chance on typed-decisions zero-shot** — the 0.766 belongs to the fine-tuned checkpoint, on that benchmark's own training split.
- **Moderation does not hold up on held-out data** (0.530, macro-F1 0.400).
- **Keep `choice` questions under ~20 options.**
- **Both checkpoints ship over-confident.** Fit temperatures on your own data.
- **Ordinal `score` is the weakest primitive** (SST-5 0.372).
- `laya` collapses outside English; `laya-multilingual` is weaker on English. Route.
